DESIGN CHOICES:
The setup for tetris is pretty standard. I created a root pane which contained the bottomPane
(with the quit button and labels) and the gamePane (with the actual game pieces and the board).
The board is a 2D array that adds pieces to it only when the pieces can fall no further. When a
line on a board is full, it is cleared, and everything above the cleared line moves down
logically and graphically. The game ends when there's a piece in the 1st row of the board
(not the 0th row because the boarder is contained in the 0th row).


KNOWN BUGS:
Sometimes the game adds an additional piece at the top of the board that overlaps a piece below
it, even if there is a piece in the top row of the board and the game should be over. After
this piece overlaps the piece in the top row, however, the game ends. Post @890 said that
this was ok on Piazza, so I'm not sure if this counts as a bug or not.

HOURS SPENT:
Too many. (But like, probably somewhere around 30 if I had to guess).
